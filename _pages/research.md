My research seeks to enhance our understanding of how environment shapes genetic variation, which has important implications for conservation, agriculture, and health. For example, genetic variation is the source of domestication phenotypes in crops; and genetic variation explains some differences in disease susceptibility and drug responses among individuals. The connections among environment, phenotype, and genotype are mediated by molecular traits such as gene expression and epigenetic modification. Accordingly, I focus on these molecular traits to decipher the underlying mechanisms of environmental effects on genetic variation. There are three fundamental processes that shape genetic variation: natural selection, mutation, and recombination. My previous work explored how environmental change affects natural selection that shapes genetic variation and gene expression variation. My current work focuses on the modifications at chromatin (epigenetic modification), which change chromatin proteins without changing the DNA and can impact how cells read the underlying genetic code. Despite evidence showing their functional importance and environmental sensitivity, little is known about their impacts on the three processes and genome evolution.
