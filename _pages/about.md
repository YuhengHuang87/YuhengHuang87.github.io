I am a postdoc/project scientist with [Dr. Grace Lee](https://grylee.science/) at UC-Irvine. My current research focuses on the evolutionary consequences of host silencing transposable elements -- "jumping genes" in the genomes.

More about me: I grew up in southern China and went to Sun Yat-sen University for my undergraduate study. I then did my PhD with [Dr. Aneil Agrawal](https://agrawal.eeb.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, Canada. After that, I worked with [Dr. John Pool](https://www.johnpool.net/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My primary study organism is *Drosophila*, commonly known as fruit flies. Outside of the lab, I am a basketball fan of the Toronto Raptors.
